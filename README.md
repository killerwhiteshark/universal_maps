## Application Type

This map app was built for my second project during my General Assembly web development coursee. The goal was to build an full Express based app that has user log in functionality using OAuth through Google, pulling data from a database, and to build the app as a C.R.U.D. for the user interaction. 

---

## Map Interaction

Using Mongo Atlas as the data center, I give the user the ability to visit 2 different sections of the park and leave reviews on the ride itself. I also included the ability to build an Itinerary of rides that the user wants to visit during their stay.
